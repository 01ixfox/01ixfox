## About Me:

I'm a developer passionate about technology and programming, with hands-on experience in designing and building digital solutions for both web and interactive environments. I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces. I also have a solid understanding of Java and Lua, which enables me to build applications and scripts for platforms like Roblox Studio.

In Roblox Studio, I have extensive experience in game development, including:

🐺 Advanced scripting in Lua, creating systems like shops, inventories, level mechanics, abilities, and more. <br>
🐺 UI/UX design within games to improve player interaction and experience. <br>
🐺 Professional building for maps, environments, and detailed structures. <br>
🐺 Visual effects (VFX) and animation to bring game mechanics to life. <br>
🐺 Performance optimization to ensure smooth gameplay. <br>
🐺 Testing and debugging to fix bugs and enhance game quality. <br>
🐺 Team collaboration through Team Create, working in real-time with other developers. <br>
🐺 Publishing and maintaining games, handling updates and user feedback on the platform. <br>

I also have experience managing MySQL databases and integrating APIs into both web and interactive projects. Additionally, I create Discord bots to automate tasks and enhance user experience in community servers.

I'm constantly learning and love working on challenging projects, always striving to deliver innovative and effective solutions.
